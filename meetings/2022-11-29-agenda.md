**From 2022-11-15:**

- [ ] [[Tom Carlson]]: Review existing NTAC repo to determine what should move over to new NIEM Open NTAC repo  

## Release of existing specifications

* Bad idea to bundle technical specifications and model into one Project Specification.  If we do that, people can't use the technical framework with their own model.
* Look at revised [dummy NIEM specification repo](https://github.com/iamdrscott/NIEM-specifications-draft)

## NIEM 5.2 release

- Do we also do a normal release along with or ahead of the OASIS release?
- Existing commitment to December release, OASIS-only release could delay that
