## Open action items

- [ ] Draft NIEM 6 version timeline (Mike Douklias)
- [ ] Organization README page for github.com/niemopen requested (Christina Medlin) & created (Kelly Cullinane)
- [ ] Draft of *Understanding the NIEM Technical Architecture* in Project Note format (Scott Renner)
- [ ] *Wildcard Augmentations in NIEM 6* distributed via NTAC mailing list (Scott Renner), reviewed by NTAC (all)

## Additional notes

### Wildcard Augmentations

- Wildcard for attributes led to a larger paper, [[2023-02-03 Wildcard Augmentations]]
- Use wildcards for elements to replace substitution groups, simplifies NDR
- Reference schema vs message schema
  - [[Scott Renner|Dr. Scott]] Reference schema are loose, message schemas are tight
- Greater reliance on tooling
  - [[David Kemp|Dave Kemp]] What about Schematron as an added layer? Could generate strict JSON Schema
    - CMF -> simpleCMF -> JSON Schema?
- [x] [[Scott Renner|Dr. Scott]] Make available to NTAC for review
- [ ] All review

### Publication Process Project Note

Remaining issues to resolve:

1. [Use of "NIEM Open"](https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/issues/8)
2. [v6.0 artifacts](https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/issues/10)

(Admin issues if time remains.)

### GTRI Resource Impacts for 2022

- GTRI resources to diminish substantially between now and the end of September
- Unknown what, if any, will be available after September
- NIEM 6 is a bigger lift than NIEM 5 was, but with fewer resources available

### Managing the Process

- [[Christina Medlin]]
  - Guide to Repos
  - Project Boards

### Technical Architecture Project Note

- [ ] Needs to reformatted into the project note template

### NDR Structure

- Separate into conceptual base document related to CMF
- Bindings for each new serialization
  - Includes information model things like cardinality
  - NIEM 6 XML Binding (representation format)
  - NIEM 6 JSON Binding (representation format)
- Do the NDR first, then the bindings
- Are we good with this? (I need to come up with resource estimates.)
