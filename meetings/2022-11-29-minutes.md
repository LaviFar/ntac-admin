## OASIS

### OASIS Release Process

- [ ] All, review Scott Renner demo repo
  - Duncan Sparrell: Want separate repos for different things to be approved
    - There's a benefit to grouping things together in a repo that get approved together
  - Christina Medlin: Can we get keywords on the index page?
  - Chet Ensign: Most folks just look back to the prior week, but sometimes folks do need to look back to find things
  - Scott Renner: Separate repos for each specifications is how we did it in the past
  - Jim Cabral: one repo for model, one for each spec
  - Duncan Sparrell: Also need ones for:
    - Tools that use the model
    - Public facing pretty repo that provides a one-stop to get to everything else
  - Jim Cabral: obvious ones
    - Minutes
    - Model
  - Duncan Sparrell: And the NDR
  - Christina Medlin: Want comments on 6.0
  - Duncan Sparrell: Old stuff can be throw out, has happen in the past
  - Scott Renner: Won't be making changed to NDR 5.0, either it gets approved or is doesn't
  - Jim Cabral: Whoever owns it now contributes it to the new repo
  - [ ] Give Chet Ensign a list of names for the repos we need created
  - Jim Cabral:
    - `NIEM-Models`
    - `NTAC-Admin`
    - `NIEM-Conformance-Targets-Attribute-Specification` (This is the oldest used thing that won't change.)
    - `NIEM-Naming-Design-Rules-Specification`
- [ ] Get with Chet Ensign and see how we have to mash up the spec text to match the rules, some preamble to apply
  - Need to request formatting templates https://www.oasis-open.org/project-administration-support-requests/form-request-template-starter-document/
  - Formatting while also adding some required text
- [x] All, review Scott Renner minutes repo
- [ ] All, review [literals document](../documents/Literals-221124.md)
- #resolved Do not record meetings

### OASIS Calendar

- [ ] Mike Douklias to schedule the calls on the OASIS calendar

## NIEM 5.2 Release

- Do we also do a normal release along with or ahead of the OASIS release?
- Existing commitment to December release, OASIS-only release could delay that
- #resolved This isn't an OASIS issue. This is between GTRI and JS J6. But is prep for OASIS

## IP

- [x] Tom Carlson: Look at the current licensing for the spec generation tools, can we just fork and contribute?
- [x] Tom Carlson: Determine the licensing around the Schematron in the spec
