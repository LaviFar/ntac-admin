## Additional Notes

### Review of OASIS Documents Call

- Keep NDR pieces as separate documents 

- - so can be versioned      separately
  - can add serializations      without a new version

- Need to use `niemopen` in the URIs

- Can keep the URIs in the schemas as-is

- Terminology 

- - psd01 to psd02 is a      "revision"
  - "major      releases" are "versions"

- Can do a 6.0.1 for patches, or as another PSD

- Each new version number means a new directory. So 6.0.1     would be a new version in a new directory. Utimately the numbering is up     to us.
