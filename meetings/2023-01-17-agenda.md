	- [literals document](https://github.com/iamdrscott/NTAC-DRAFT/blob/main/meetings/2022-11-15/Literals.md)
	- [[Literals-Dr-Scott]] (local copy)
- How do we handle:
	- Security markings?
		- Have the [[ISM]] folks done anything with JSON?
	- Code lists?

[[Scott Renner|Dr. Scott]] NIEM 3 was a hack, but brings ugly JSON now, fix with a way to augment any type with attributes and elements

Proposed fix via an approach to ISM attributes that will work equally well for anyone else who needs attribute augmentations: [[AttributeAugmentations-230105]]

## NDR 6 Planning
