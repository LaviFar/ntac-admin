## NIEM Open Process Document

- [[Jim Cabral]] and [[Christina Medlin]] to lead
- Collaborating on Github
	- Make pull requests with your changes, or
	- Post issues on Github
		- Posting issues allows for tracked discussions
	- Existing comments will be placed into issues

## NDR 6 Planning

- Proposal to simplified by
	- focusing on the critical conformance targets
	- streamlining the principles and combining rules where possible
	- keeping Schematron for conformance use, but not embedded in the NDR
- Scope of changes provides an opportunity to abandon the specification generation toolset
	- Process:
		- Convert current NDR from HTML to Markdown
		- Edit the Markdown, _including collaboration_
		- Convert to HTML, applying formatting as-is, and exporting to PDF for publication
	- This probably takes fewer resources than collating changes, editing the current source, then generating HTML, then applying formatting
	- Removes dependency on GTRI to edit specs
	- Removes any issues about tool licenses
	- Follow same process for other specs

## Literals and Attribute Augmentations

Proposed fix via an approach to ISM attributes that will work equally well for anyone else who needs attribute augmentations: [[AttributeAugmentations-230105]]
