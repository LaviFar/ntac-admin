# 1 Introduction

Introductory material.

## 1.1 Glossary

### 1.1.1 Definitions of terms

- **NIEMOpen** (or **NIEM**) refers to a reference data model and related specifications.
- The NIEM **Core** refers to the content of the referance data model that is not associated with a specific Domain.
- A NIEM **Domain** refers to content of the reference data model that is associated with a specific segment of government or industry.

### 1.2.2 Acronyms and abbreviations

- **CMF**: Common Model Format
- **CTAS**: Conformance Target Attribute Specification
- **NMO**: NIEM Management Office TSC
- **NBAC**: NIEM Business Architecture Committee TSC
- **NTAC**: NIEM Technical Architecture Committee TSC
- **PGB**: Project Governance Board
- **TSC**: Technical Steering Committee

Note: NIEM is not a acronym

### 1.2.3 Document conventions

- Naming conventions
- Font colors and styles
- Typographic conventions
- Remove this section if unnecessary

### 1.3 Assumptions

- The NIEM Publication Process MUST comply with [OP requirements](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/#progression-of-project-work) (see sections 11-14) including:
  - Emailing the [project distribution list](mailto:niemopen@lists.oasis-open.org) to announce any artifacts that require a vote of the PGB to approve (e.g. release/group releases, PSD, PS) at least 14 days in advance of the vote
  - Conforming PSDs and later to the PS template, which includes methods for indicating the relevant designated branches and applicable licenses
  - Ensuring any code included in a PS is composed only of Releases or Group Releases bearing Implementer-Class Licenses.
  - Ensuring any other content in a PS was contributed to a project repository
- The PGB SHOULD charter a Harmonization Subcommittee under the NBAC to review and recommend content changes to the model.

-------

# 2 Versions

NIEM versions will typically be published annually on a 3-year cycle.  A NIEM major version one year will be followed by minor versions the next two years.

## 2.1 Major Versions
Each NIEM major version:
- SHOULD include a reference data model, including any changes (additions, deletions, updates) to the model in previous version
- SHOULD include related specifications (e.g., Code Lists, Common Model Format, Conformance, Conformance Targents Attribute Specification, Message Specification, Naming and Design Rules, JSON binding, XML binding), including any changes (additions, deletions, updates) to the specifications in previous version
- SHOULD progress to OASIS Project Specification(s) (PS)
- MAY progress to OASIS Standard(s) and be submitted for ISO standard(s)

## 2.2 Minor Versions
Each NIEM minor version:
- MAY include updates to the reference data model in the previous version, including any changes (additions) to the Core or Domains
- MAY imclude updates to specifications in previous versions but SHOULD NOT include significant changes to the architecture 
- MAY address any defects in the data model or specifications in errata
- SHOULD progress to OASIS Project Specification(s) (PS)

-------
# 3 Project Artifacts

## 3.1 Published specifications
- Public review versions of project specifications MUST BE published at https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/niem
- For URI permanency, all NIEMOpen artifacts should use https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/niem as the root URI (e.g., in XML schema locations)
## 3.2 Project repositories
- Github repositories SHOULD be used primarily for sharing working versions of project artifacts with project members.
- All project repositories SHOULD reside under https://github.com/niemopen. e.g., 
  - Model repo: https://github.com/niemopen/niem-models
  - CTAS repo: https://github.com/niemopen/niem-conformance-targets
### 3.2.1 Branches
- Github branches SHOULD be used to segregate contributions that are not yet approved. e.g.,
  - `main`: approved specifications
  - `dev`: for incremental changes not yet approved
Temporary branches MAY be created as needed (ad hoc)
### 3.2.2 Tags
- Tags SHOULD be used to identify NIEM version and OASIS deliverable stage, e.g. `niem-6.0-ps` to 
## 3.3 XML Schemas
- XML schemas associated with the same NIEM version SHOULD use similar location URIs for maintainability
## 3.4 Approval of project artifacts
- When possible, TSCs SHOULD combine PGB notifications of related artifacts.
- TSCs SHOULD use permanent links to specific commits for approval by the PGB.
## 3.5 Legacy (pre-NIEMOpen) content and repositories      
- Previous NIEM models not yet contributed to the open project SHOULD continue to reside at https://release.niem.gov
- NIEM specifications not yet contributed to the open project SHOULD continue to reside at https://reference.niem.gov
- Pre-NIEMOpen repositories, Github and otherwise, MAY still be available but changes and new issues SHOULD NOT be accepted.

# 4 Publication Processes
## 4.1 Publishing a minor version
This section describes the stages in publishing a minor version and the steps during each stage of ths process.
### 4.1.1 Designated Branch
This process begins the domain and other non-Core-related updates to the model:
1. Maintainers create a designated branch for a new version
2. Contributors create pull requests for each issue
 a. Each Domain Committee accepts changes to changes in their domain
 b. Harmonization Subcommittee accepts changes to:
   - Non-domain code tables, adapters and external standards, Core supplements, etc.
   - Other content if the authority (e.g. Domain Committee) is unresponsive
   - Harmonization Committee reviews content and accepts changes to harmonize domains and Core
### 4.1.2 Release
Once all major content changes have been submitted:
1. Contributors continue to create pull requests (as above)
2. TSCs review the designated branch and contribute changes (as needed)
3. Once all TSCs approve the changes, maintainers add the appropriate tag (e.g., `niem-6.0-release1`) and publish as a Github release
4. TSCs announce release to the [project distribution list](mailto:niemopen@lists.oasis-open.org) for a 14 day review period
5. Contributors submit feedback via GitHub issues and pull requests
6. Maintainers review feedback, continuing to get TSC approval before accepting pull requests
7. TSCs review the release and request approval of additional releases (as needed)
### 4.1.3 Project Specification Draft
Once all known changes have been submitted for the version and the TSCs are satisfied with the release:
1. TSCs announce on the [project distribution list](mailto:niemopen@lists.oasis-open.org) their recommendation that the PGB approve the release as a PSD
2. If the PGB approves the PSD,
 a. Maintainers add the appropriate tag (e.g., `niem-6.0-psd1`) and publish as a Github release
 b. TSCs announce the PSD to the [project distribution list](mailto:niemopen@lists.oasis-open.org) for a 14 day review period
 c. Contributors submit feedback via GitHub issues and pull requests
 d. Maintainers review feedback, continuing to get TSC approval before accepting pull requests
 e. TSCs review the release and request approval of additional PSDs (as needed)
### 4.1.4 Project Specification
Once the TSCs are satisfied with the PSD:
1. TSCs announce on the [project distribution list](mailto:niemopen@lists.oasis-open.org) their recommendation that the PGB approve the PSD as a PS
2. If the PGB approves the PS (by Special Majority Vote),
 a. Maintainers add the appropriate tag (e.g., `niem-6.0-ps1`) and publish as a Github release
 b. TSCs announce the PS to the [project distribution list](mailto:niemopen@lists.oasis-open.org)
 c. Open Project Administrators publish the PS on https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/niem
## 4.2 Publishing a major version
The process of publishing a major version will be similar to [4.1 Publishing a NIEM minor versions](#4.1-publishing-minor-version), with the following additional steps to the Designated Branch stage.
### 4.2.1 Designated Branch
5. Harmonization Subcommittee reviews Core and Core-related pull requests
6. NBAC Harmonization Subcommittee meets regularly for harmonization work
7. NTAC reviews architectural-related pull requests for the model
8. NTAC updates the related specifications
